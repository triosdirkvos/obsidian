*Obsidian plugin and CSS code - tips tricks*

In this repository, the `raw` versions or **plugin code** or **CSS changes** will be published. When I am creating blogposts or Youtube videos about the way I use Obsidian as a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system, I will link in the blogposts and in the comments of the videos to the Wiki of this repository where all the files will be saved. 

Use all of this information for your own vault in Obsidian. You may copy them, alter them and publish them: just add a reference to my blog and Youtube channel.
